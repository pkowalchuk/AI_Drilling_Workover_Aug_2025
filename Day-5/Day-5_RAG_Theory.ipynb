        "CHAPTER 1: SAFETY PROCEDURES\n",
        "\n",
        "1.1 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n",
        "All personnel on the drilling site must wear appropriate PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, steel-toed boots, and high-visibility clothing. Hearing protection is required in areas where noise levels exceed 85 decibels. PPE inspection must be conducted daily before shift start.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.2 Gas Detection and Monitoring\n",
        "Continuous gas monitoring is essential during drilling operations. H2S detectors must be calibrated daily and positioned at strategic locations around the drilling site. Emergency shutdown procedures must be initiated if gas levels exceed safe thresholds of 10 ppm for H2S.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.3 Blowout Prevention\n",
        "The blowout preventer (BOP) system must be tested daily according to API standards. All crew members must be trained in emergency procedures including well control and evacuation protocols. BOP stack pressure testing should be performed at 70% of working pressure.\n",
        "\n",
        "CHAPTER 2: DRILLING EQUIPMENT\n",
        "\n",
        "2.1 Rotary Table Operations\n",
        "The rotary table provides the primary rotation for the drill string. Operating parameters include rotation speed typically ranging from 60-200 RPM depending on formation type and bit characteristics. Regular maintenance includes checking for wear on the master bushing and ensuring proper lubrication every 8 hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.2 Mud Pump Systems\n",
        "Mud pumps circulate drilling fluid through the system. Pump pressure should be monitored continuously with typical operating pressures ranging from 1000-4000 PSI. Pump liner inspection should be performed every 500 hours of operation. Maximum allowable pressure is 5000 PSI.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.3 Drawworks and Hoisting System\n",
        "The drawworks controls the hoisting and lowering of the drill string. Load limits must never exceed the rated capacity of 750,000 pounds. Daily inspection of wire rope is mandatory, checking for broken wires, kinks, or excessive wear. Replace wire rope when 6 broken wires are found in one lay.\n",
        "\n",
        "CHAPTER 3: DRILLING FLUIDS\n",
        "\n",
        "3.1 Mud Properties\n",
        "Drilling mud density typically ranges from 8.5 to 18 pounds per gallon depending on formation pressure requirements. Viscosity should be maintained between 35-50 seconds using a marsh funnel. pH levels should be kept between 9-11 for optimal performance. Gel strength should be measured every 4 hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.2 Mud Treatment Chemicals\n",
        "Common additives include barite for weight increase, bentonite for viscosity, and various polymers for fluid loss control. Chemical additions must be recorded in the daily drilling report with quantities and timing noted. Typical barite addition rate is 100-300 pounds per barrel to increase mud weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "CHAPTER 4: FORMATION EVALUATION\n",
        "\n",
        "4.1 Logging While Drilling (LWD)\n",
        "LWD tools provide real-time formation data including resistivity, density, and neutron readings. Data quality checks should be performed every 50 feet of drilling progress. Calibration procedures must be followed according to service company specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.2 Casing and Cementing\n",
        "Casing strings must be designed to withstand formation pressures and provide wellbore integrity. Cement slurry design should achieve compressive strength of at least 2000 PSI within 24 hours. Cement bond logs should be run to verify cement placement quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "CHAPTER 5: WELL COMPLETION\n",
        "\n",
        "5.1 Perforating Operations\n",
        "Perforating guns must be properly assembled and tested before deployment. Shot density typically ranges from 4-16 shots per foot depending on completion design. Safety procedures require personnel to maintain safe distance of at least 500 feet during perforating operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.2 Production Tubing Installation\n",
        "Production tubing must be inspected for defects before installation. Tubing weight calculations must account for fluid loading and thermal effects. Packer setting depths should be verified against completion drawings.\n",
        "\n",
        "CHAPTER 6: EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\n",
        "\n",
        "6.1 Well Control Situations\n",
        "In case of a kick (influx of formation fluids), the well should be shut in immediately using the BOP. Mud weight should be increased gradually while circulating out the kick. Never allow gas to reach surface equipment. Maximum allowable shut-in pressure is 3000 PSI.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.2 Equipment Failures\n",
        "Power failures require immediate activation of backup generators within 30 seconds. Hydraulic failures on BOPs require switching to backup accumulator systems. All equipment failures must be logged and reported to the drilling supervisor immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.3 Personnel Safety\n",
        "In case of H2S exposure, affected personnel should be moved to fresh air immediately. Emergency breathing apparatus should be available at all times. Evacuation procedures should be practiced monthly. Wind direction indicators must be visible from all work areas.\n",
